The project aimed to develop a web-based leasing application that could prevent the users 
from contacting the Covid-19 when they get the products based on the different surfaces. 
The system was implemented by the architecture of Redux for the client-side and Model View 
Controller architecture for the server-side. The client-side was developed in React.js, CSS. 

On the other hand, the server-side was designed by Node.js and its framework, Express.js. 
Among NoSQL tools, MongoDB was chosen to be the database and the Object Document Mapper (ODM),
mongoose. Aside from that, the project would be tested to be robust and stable to use. 

Finally, the chapter of evaluation through surveys taken by potential users, and discussion
would be presented and analyzed this application to explore its achievement, improvement, and
development for the future.
